### About myself

I graduated from the Kharkov Polytechnic Institute for the specialization of an electric drive (bachelor's degree) and robotics (master Master).
He was engaged in target advertising, the development of sites on the CMS, the maintenance of publics on social networks and the calculation of the cost and strength of PVC products (windows, doors, partitions).
Programming always attracted, but discarded the idea to do purposefully. Now I decided to catch up and, nevertheless, become a specialist in this area.

# Code Example

```
//Your task is to create the functionisDivideBy (or is_divide_by) to check if an integer number is divisible by both integers a and b.

A few cases:


(-12, 2, -6)  ->  true
(-12, 2, -5)  ->  false

(45, 1, 6)    ->  false
(45, 5, 15)   ->  true

(4, 1, 4)     ->  true
(15, -5, 3)   ->  true
//

My solution:

function isDivideBy(number, a, b) {
if (number%a === 0 && number%b === 0){
    return true
  }
  else{
    return false
  }
}
isDivideBy(2, 4, 5)
```

### English

A2 - B1 - quite a lot and for a long time studied with tutors; went to language courses from Michael Gott International (2 years in a row), but there was no practice and need for too long.
